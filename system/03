#Q3. What file has to be modified to make it permanent?

We need to edit a file called /etc/hostname:
    >> vi /etc/hostname

Set new hostname: didi.com

Save and close the file.
Then we need to reboot the system or run any one of the following command:
>> /etc/init.d/hostname.sh start OR >> invoke-rc.d hostname.sh startca
