#Q4. What command gives you the time since your system was last booted?

#!/bin/bash
last reboot

# 
# uptime shows the amount of time that has passed since the system has been booted 
# or how long the system has been running. It does not tell you the system clock 
# or system boot time.
# System boot time information is stored /var/run/wtmp file.
# last reboot will show a log of all reboots since the log file was created.
