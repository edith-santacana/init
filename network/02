# Q2 - Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics:
# (a) Identify broadcast address
# (b) Identify all IP adresses which are part of the same subnet

#!/bin/bash

# 02.a
interface="en0"
a=`ifconfig ${interface} | grep "broadcast"| awk '{print $6}'`
echo $a

# 02.b
nmap -sn ${a}/16

# Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source network scanner.
# Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network 
# by sending packets and analyzing the responses.
# This does a simple ping scan in the entire subnet to see which hosts are online.
